How to play
-----------

To start the game, simply run "game.exe".

The game is controlled mostly with the arrow keys, Z key, and X key. Z key is select on menus / hiscore entry, X key is cancel. ESC is also cancel, and ENTER is also select. SHIFT can be used to slow down the speed at which the hiscore entry cursor moves.

In play, these are the controls.
Arrow Keys...Movement
Hold Z.......Lightningbolt shot (while held)
Push X.......Stormfront Shield (tap, 3 per life)
Hold LSHIFT..Switch to maneuvering engines (while held)
ESC..........Abort Mission (return to title screen)

The TORNADO's vital cross-section (or hitbox) is extremely small, much smaller than the TORNADO itself. It is precisely in the center of the TORNADO's sprite. If and only if the TORNADO is struck in its vital cross section, it will be destroyed. Glanncing blows are ineffective against "TORNADO".
The Stormfront Shield will erase bullets and make you briefly invincible, but it has limited uses (3 per life) and cannot affect "ROBOT DRAGON".

When an enemy is destroyed, it will drop a point item. Collect this to increase your score. The higher on the screen you are, the more score a point item will give. Destroying enemies also gives you a small number of points.
In addition, if you defeat "ROBOT DRAGON", you will gain a large number of points, and more points for lives and bombs you have remaining.

This is all of the help you get. Fight bravely to protect the Earth!!
